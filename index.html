                    <p>The most widely used programming language on the planet is JavaScript. 
                        JavaScript (sometimes abbreviated to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, 
                        object-oriented programming language with first-class functions. 
                        It is most commonly used as a scripting language for Web pages, although it 
                        is also utilized in a variety of non-browser applications. It's a dynamic, 
                        prototype-based scripting language that supports object-oriented, imperative, 
                        and functional programming techniques.Web programming is done with JavaScript.</p>
                
                    <p>Both a procedural and an object-oriented language, JavaScript may be used. In 
                        contrast to the syntactic class declarations typical in compiled languages like C++ 
                        and Java, objects are formed dynamically in JavaScript by adding methods and attributes 
                        to otherwise empty objects at runtime. After an item has been built, it may be used as 
                        a blueprint (or prototype) for making more things.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript may be used to build the most dynamic and interactive 
                            web sites. It's the greatest programming language for creating stunning front-end designs. 
                            When it comes to processing user inputs and validation, JavaScript scripts are essential 
                            components of website development.
                        </li>
                        <li>Back-end: You may use JavaScript to create the web application's back-end. For the web, 
                            developers choose NodeJs. It aids in improving front-end and web application performance. 
                            Back-end development is critical since it allows you to control whole programs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Web Apps: To create web applications, you can utilize the JavaScript programming language. 
                            These web applications are nothing more than a more advanced version of a website with a variety 
                            of features that enable us to do specific activities. It's especially handy for Progressive Web 
                            Apps (PWAs), which are similar to mobile apps.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript was built for client-side use in mobile apps. However, the language may be used in a 
                            dynamic fashion to implement in a variety of situations. CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PhoneGap may 
                            all be used to build hybrid mobile apps. For cross-platform mobile app development, you may utilize 
                            another framework, Ionic. PhoneGap serves as a bridge between the mobile device and the web application code.</li>

                    <p>For each particular project, no one language is the ideal option. Although some aspects, such as speed, security 
                        in business applications, and fewer lines of code, may be prioritized. It may be as easy as choosing a personal 
                        favorite when it comes to programming languages. The brevity of the lines of code is crucial in this case. 
                        The fewer lines required for the project's development, the better.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the things to think about are:</p>
                    <ol>

                    <p>Javascript or JS is a scripting language while Python is an Object oriented and high level programming language.
                        Javascript was created by Brendan Eich(Netscape) and is now maintained by ECMA. The most recent version of JavaScript 
                        released in 2018 is ECMAScript 2018(ECMAScript is the official name of Javascript) while Python was created by Guido 
                        van Rossum. The most recent version of Python is 3.9 which was released in October 2020. They are both dynamically 
                        typed languages.

                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript uses curly braces ({}) to group statements that belong to the same code block.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <code>if (x < 5) {
                        console.log(x);
                    }
                    <br><br>
                        function foo(x) {
                            console.log(x);
                        }
                    </code>

                <article>
                    <p>You need to add the keyword var before the name of the variable and end with a line od semicolon (;)
                    Therrefore, when you use var to define a variable, the variable has a function scope</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="variables_naming">
                <header>Variables naming</header>
                <article>
                    <p>We should use the lowerCamelCase naming style in JavaScript. The name starts with a lowercase letter and then every new word starts 
                        with an uppercase letter. Thereby, it is advisable for variable names to use lowerCamelCasing, and use concise, human-readable, semantic names where appropriate.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                        <code>firstName</code>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="constant">
                <header>Constant</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <code>const TAX_RATE_PERCENTAGE = 25;</code>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="data_types_and_values">
                <header>Data types and values</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Javascript has two numeric types which are Number and BigInt . Integers and floating-point numbers are both considered to be of type number. We have the null value which represents the intentional absence of any object value abd we also have the undefined value 
                        which is a special value that is assigned when we declare a variable without assigning an initial value. Lastly, we have primitive data types which consist of six and they are undefined, Boolean, String, Number, BigInt and Symbol</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <code>> var x; <br>
                        < undefined <br>
                        > x <br>
                        < undefined
